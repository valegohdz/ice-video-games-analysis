## Strategic Recommendations
- North America and Europe share similar genre and rating preferences, allowing partially unified marketing strategies. However, campaigns should adapt to the dominant platform in each region (Xbox vs. PlayStation).  
- Japan requires a differentiated strategy focused on Role-Playing games, Nintendo platforms, and broader audience targeting.  
- Since market behavior varies significantly by region, segmented advertising strategies are essential for maximizing commercial success.  
- Continuous monitoring of genre, platform, and rating trends is necessary to maintain competitive positioning.
